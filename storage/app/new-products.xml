    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Nipple shields are designed to help you breastfeed when you are experiencing nipple issues or latch-on challenges. The ultra-thin butterfly-shaped nipple shield allows breast contact for baby and helps continue bonding as you breastfeed.  We designed our Nipple Shields to help babies with early latch-on challenges and help you breastfeed for longer*. For mothers with flat and inverted nipples and babies with weak sucking technique or oral anomalies, the Nipple Shield can provide a nipple shape for latching on, keeping and maintaining a protruded position during baby's feeding pauses.  Our Nipple Shields' ultra-thin butterfly shape is designed for skin-to-skin contact for baby. Thanks to the shape, not only the nose is in contact with the breast, but also the chin, allowing the baby to smell mum's scent and touch mum's skin. Just position the shield over the centre of your nipple to make sure that your baby can properly latch on to the entire areola. Enjoy bonding with your little one while protecting your nipples.  If mum's milk flow needs controlling or the baby lacks strength, nipple shields are also a great support. The three holes in the tip of the shield can help rate the breastmilk flow for the baby in case there is an oversupply of milk. This way the baby can drink at his own pace in case the mother is experiencing an overactive let-down.  Nipple shields are designed to provide comfort and gentler feedings for sore, cracked or painful nipples. They can help reduce rubbing and stretching of nipples during breastfeeding so you can feed baby your best milk in comfort.  You need to clean the nipple shields before each use, which takes less than 10 minutes. Place them in boiled water for five minutes or optionally use the Hygiene case. Place both well-rinsed nipple shields in the case and add 25 ml/0.9 fl. oz. water. Then place the nipple shields in a 750–1,000 W microwave for three minutes. Let them cool for five minutes. Then drain the water and they're ready to use. Use the convenient hygienic carrying case on the go as well as to store your nipple shields and to keep them clean. </Data></Cell>
